An updated version of the well-known Prisma puzzle timer.

How to install:
Download the latest jar from the releases tab, then move it to wherever you want to keep it (I recommend making a prisma folder somewhere), then run the jar file. The db files are stored in the same folder as the jar, sorry for not making that clear but I'll try simplify the install in the future.

Main features:

- Support for 2x2x2-7x7x7, Rubik's clock, Megaminx, Pyraminx, Square-1, Skewb, Floppy cube (1x3x3), Tower cube (2x2x3), Rubik's tower (2x2x4) and Rubik's domino (2x3x3)
- Custom categories
- Random state scramblers for 2x2x2, 3x3x3, Rubik's clock, Pyraminx, Square-1, Skewb, Floppy cube, Tower cube, Rubik's tower and Rubik's domino
- Fixed length random state scramblers for 2x2x2 and Pyraminx
- Special scramblers for 3x3x3 and Square-1
- Tips for 3x3x3 (optimal cross, BLD methods) and Square-1 (optimal cube shape)
- Zero-configuration Stackmat Timer support (actually, you have to select the input device)
- Keyboard timer using space or ctrl keys
- Inspection time
- 3D visualization of scrambles
- History window with histogram, graph, statistics and times
- Scramble queue manipulation
